For this project, my contribution focused on creating the homepage and its associated functionality, including the files index.html, script.js, three product images (shoe1.png, shoe2.png, shoe3.jpg), the styling in style.css, and the documentation in README.md. The index.html file forms the backbone of the website, providing a clear and organized structure for the content. It begins with standard HTML5 declarations and meta tags that ensure the page displays correctly on all devices. The page is divided into meaningful sections, starting with a header that contains the navigation bar. This navigation includes the website logo and links to the Home, Products, and Contact pages, allowing users to easily navigate through the site. The hero section below the header introduces the main brand message, “FOREVER FASTER,” accompanied by a short tagline and a call-to-action button that directs users to the product page. This section is designed to capture attention immediately and encourage interaction. Below the hero, the featured products section showcases three popular shoes, each displayed in a card layout with an image, a product name, and a short description. The footer provides copyright information and completes the page in a visually balanced way. Overall, index.html organizes the content clearly and sets up the structure needed for the styling and interactive features that follow.

The style.css file brings the page to life visually. It controls the layout, typography, colors, spacing, and responsiveness of the site. For instance, the navigation bar is styled so that links are clear, visually separated, and highlighted when active. The hero section is given a bold design with spacing and font sizes that emphasize the main message. The product cards are aligned neatly using grid or flexbox layouts, ensuring that they look consistent across different screen sizes. Buttons, colors, and text styles are all designed to make the interface attractive while maintaining readability. Media queries are used to adjust the layout on mobile devices, so the page remains fully functional and visually appealing regardless of screen size. In short, style.css ensures that the website is both beautiful and professional, providing a polished visual experience for users.

The script.js file adds interactivity and functionality to the site. One of its features uses the browser’s localStorage to track the user’s last visit. When the page loads, the script checks if there is a stored visit date, logs it in the console, and then updates it with the current date and time. This demonstrates how websites can store information on the client side to provide a more personalized experience. Another important function of the script is validating the contact form. The script listens for the form submission, prevents it from sending data automatically, and checks that the name, email, and message meet specific requirements. For example, the name must have at least three characters, the email must follow a valid format, and the message must be at least ten characters long. If any of these rules are not met, an error message is displayed in red; otherwise, a green confirmation message appears, and the form is reset. This ensures users provide correct information and improves the overall experience of interacting with the site. Through these scripts, I was able to demonstrate an understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and client-side validation.

The three product images, shoe1.png, shoe2.png, and shoe3.jpg, play a crucial role in making the website visually engaging. Each image represents a different product, showing variety and appealing to different audiences. They are placed inside the product cards and accompanied by descriptive text. Choosing the right image format was also important: PNG for crisp graphics and transparency, JPG for high-quality photos with efficient file sizes. These images help users visualize the products, make the page more lively, and give it a professional, e-commerce feel.

The README.md file serves as documentation for the project. It provides an overview of the website, explains its purpose, lists the technologies used, and outlines instructions for installation and usage. This is important because it allows other developers, instructors, or collaborators to understand the project quickly without having to examine the code directly. The README demonstrates good professional practice, showing that the project is organized and understandable, even to someone new to the repository.

Together, these files create a complete, cohesive website. index.html establishes the structure and content, style.css adds visual styling and responsive design, script.js provides dynamic functionality and user interaction, the images enhance branding and engagement, and the README documents everything clearly. This combination results in a user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing website that demonstrates both technical skill and attention to user experience. By working on this project, I was able to apply key web development principles, including semantic HTML, responsive CSS design, JavaScript interactivity, asset optimization, and thorough documentation, which are all critical skills for creating professional-quality web applications.
